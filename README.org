* Piper

A simple, tough, airworthy pipline template
work in progress, it works but is not entirely tested as a general use
All code has been used in production and suits my needs well as a development workflow.

Piper can also wrap over existing manual workflows.

* run.sh

These calls indirectly call piper and ensure nice logfile handling

./run.sh
single input noninteractive
./run.sh full
